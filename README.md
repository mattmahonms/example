# Intro to git and go

NOTE: I recommend installing all software to their default directories on Windows or Mac

## Install git:

[https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Just install the plain git, no GUIs. This is a version control system that allows simple control of your source code through a push/pull mechanism.

## Create github/bitbucket account:

Optional but *highly* recommended this is a website that acts as a simple web storage system for your git repos.

## Install gitkraken:

[http://www.gitkraken.com/](http://www.gitkraken.com/) LUXURIOUS gui for git on all platforms. OPTIONAL: you will definitely want this later though.

## Install go:

[https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) modern replacement for C/C++ courtesy of your benevolent overlords at Google

## Install atom:
    
[https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/) Source editor written in HTML/CSS3/Node.js. OPTIONAL: but totally awesome.

## Create directory:

I recommend using something like C:\dev\ for all dev work, with subdirectories like \go\program. Open a git bash in your dev folder (right click background of explorer window in Windows; I imagine mac is similar). Run the following command: git clone https://github.com/matthewmahoneyms/example.git. In Atom, use File -> Add Project Directory to add projects to the program (I also recommend enabling the tree view in Atom).
